# The Hive

Hive is a CRUD blogging app. It is a place where
User can enter under the disguise of an insect pseudonym;
User can view all created posts by other insects;
User can edit the existing posts;
User can create a new post;
The main page (The Hive itself) showcases every post - it's title is a clickable link and the snippet for each post displays a little snapshot from the beginning of the post.
The Hive is hosted on Digital Ocean: http://45.55.139.174:3000/


Here is a link to TRELLO, where I manage the workflow:

Following NPM modules were used in creation of this masterpiece:
express
ejs
body-parser
method-Override
sqlite3
request


### Considerations for enhancement:
add password log-in for users, allow posting under pseudoyms only when password is verified.
Constant design work is a must!
A user can view an author's page that lists the posts that they have created or edited.
